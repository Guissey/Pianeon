# Pianeon

## Description

Work in progress  
This project's goal is to create light effects while playing the piano according to the notes played (as often seen in the youtube videos).  
I'm trying to reach this goal with my own resources. I use an **electric keyboard** with an **USB MIDI ouput**, an **ESP32-S3** microcontroller and a **WS2812B** led strip. The hardware development is done with the **PlatformIO** extension of _VSCode_ using _Arduino framework_
